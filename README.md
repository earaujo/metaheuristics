# Metaheuristics Research Algorithms

Each folder has a different purpose:

* **eo**: it contains an extension for the [*Evolving Objects*](http://eodev.sourceforge.net/)
(EO) Library, written in C++; that extension is a hybridization module for Genetic Algorithms,
named In Vitro Fertilization Module (IVFm), or In Vitro Fertilization Genetic Algorithm (IVF-GA).
That folder also contains an application code, an algorithm that uses IVF-GA as a solver to
some Multidimensional 0-1 Knapsack instances.

* **scheduling**: it contains application code for some well known scheduling problem classes,
mainly Open-shop, Flow-shop, and Job-shop. Each one has its problem instances files, used for
results analysis and algorithm tuning. Those instances files are not mine and should be disregarded
from the LICENSE scope. That application code is also written upon the "evolve" code noted above.

## Dependencies

 * [Evolving Objects](http://eodev.sourceforge.net/)
 * [Evolve](http://evolvecode.org/)
